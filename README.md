I am a Senior at Northern Kentucky University graduating Decemeber 2021 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Lots of the assignments from classes I have taken there are available in my repos.

I am currently employeed at Roto-Rooter Services Company where I am an IT Intern (for now). My responsibilities consist of developing applications in Salesforce based off of legacy apps in various systems (AS/400, SharePoint, AVR.NET, etc). I have also written some ASP.NET web services for various applications (linking the AS/400 and Salesforce typically).

I am a certified Salesforce Platform Developer I (PDI) since June 2021.
